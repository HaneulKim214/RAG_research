- Extract investor-relevant details when present: catalysts, guidance/outlook, management quotes, numbers (revenue, EPS, margin, units),
  regulatory/legal items, macro impacts, competitive dynamics, product/tech updates, valuation/price targets.
- Deduplicate across videos; consolidate overlapping facts. If claims conflict, present both and mark uncertainty.
- If a video is unavailable or lacks usable content/transcript, list it under Unprocessed with a short reason.
